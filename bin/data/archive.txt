biodiversity# On land, areas near the equator tend to be more diverse because of the pleasant climate. 
biodiversity# Biodiversity is very important to an ecosystem because each species plays a different role in the maintenance of the ecosystem. 
biodiversity# Disasters tend to ruin an ecosystem but if biodiversity is high, the ecosystem will be able to recover quickly. 
Biodiversity# Preserving a species and its habitat is one way to ensure an increase in biodiversity# The increase in global warming is a huge factor that decreases biodiversity by destroying habitats of certain organisms. 
biodiversity# Changes in ocean temperature, length of seasons, and amount of precipitation are all factors that affect the level of biodiversity. 
biodiversity# Planting certain types of trees outside your home or school is one way to combat the decrease in biodiversity because it helps control climate.
